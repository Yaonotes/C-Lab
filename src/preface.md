# Preface

This is a book introducing basics in programming in C/C++.

## Content

I will try to cover the most important and theoretical parts in data structures (Linked List, Trees, BFS, etc). Besides, I will try to briefly introduce how to compile the program, organize the project structures and some other basic knowledges.

As a principle, I will not discuss the applications of these data structures.

The content will be structrued into two main parts:

* The first part will be the basic knowledge about C/C++, including pointers, arrays, STL, file IO, etc.
* The second part will be the data structures and algorithms. We will try to implement Trees, Linked List, etc together.

## Code

You can find the corresponding code at our [GitHub](https://github.com/Yaonotes/C-Lab).
